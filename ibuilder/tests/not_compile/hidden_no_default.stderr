   = note: the method `builder` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `&Foo : ibuilder::Buildable<_>`
           `&mut Foo : ibuilder::Buildable<_>`
           `Foo : ibuilder::Buildable<_>`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `builder`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `ibuilder::Buildable`
