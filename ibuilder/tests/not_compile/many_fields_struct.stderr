error[E0599]: no function or associated item named `builder` found for struct `Foo` in the current scope

  = note: the method `builder` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `&Foo : ibuilder::Buildable<_>`
          `&mut Foo : ibuilder::Buildable<_>`
          `Foo : ibuilder::Buildable<_>`
  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following trait defines an item `builder`, perhaps you need to implement it:
          candidate #1: `ibuilder::Buildable`
