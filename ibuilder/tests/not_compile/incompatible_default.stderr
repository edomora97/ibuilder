  = help: the following implementations were found:
            <i64 as std::convert::From<bool>>
            <i64 as std::convert::From<i16>>
            <i64 as std::convert::From<i32>>
            <i64 as std::convert::From<i8>>
          and 4 others
  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::convert::Into<i64>` for `&str`
